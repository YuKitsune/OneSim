# OneSim
One sim is an easy to use logbook, hangar manager, and Swiss Army knife designed for Flight Simulation enthusiests. It was originally designed to be cloud based, we've since decided to make it open-source and initially design it as a dekstop application.

# Current goals
- Logbook of flights
- Hangar of available aircraft
  - Aircraft statistics
- Peer-to-peer based Connected flight deck
- Regular autosaving
- Interactive map with Online Flight Simulation Network traffic data (VATSIM, IVAO, etc.)
  - Use locally stored sector files for navigation data

# Current status
We're currently in the process of moving much of the cloud code into the WPF desktop application.
